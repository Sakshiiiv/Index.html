<P>Since 1944, Bal Bharati Public School has championed the cause of nourishing the rich tradition with a progressive attitude towards the future, fostering academic rigor with a caring heart,
 and appreciating individuals with the warmth of a cohesive school community.
 Today, in a world where society is increasingly fragmented and polarized, our school remains a community where honesty and integrity matter, sincerity and hard work are equally important values,
 and where the process of education is as important as the grades. <BR> </P>

<H4>Our philosophy of education has always been meeting the needs of the individual child. Children acquire skills and knowledge easily if we make the surroundings stimulating and purposeful.
 In the 21st century, the digital revolution has affected us all. Quite simply, it is changing everything: a brilliant barrage of information, entertainment,
 companionship and education is speedily available. In this era of cut throat competition,
 it is of paramount importance to impart an integrated education to the future citizens of the nation for successfully facing challenges. Bal Bharati Public School, therefore,
 lays special emphasis on life skill activities, providing students an edge over others to be leaders in their respective field of activity.
 Through life skills programme,
 the school aims to develop a cadre of empowered, educated and healthy adolescents, capable of making decisions in life</H4>

<H4>The school was the brainchild of Air Marshal M. S. Chaturvedi who encountered problems trying to get his children admitted to a school in New Delhi while he was posted there with the Air Force.
[1] The school was started by the Indian Air Force Educational and Cultural Society,
 which also runs The Air Force School (Suboroto Park) and Air Force Golden Jubilee Institute,
 with the aim of educating children of Air Force personnel posted to the National Capital Region.
 AFBBS made its beginning as a primary school, on 15 July 1955 with 116 pupils and six members of staff. The school was housed in war time barracks.

By 1974 it had grown into a fully-fledged senior secondary school offering education to over 3300 pupils.
 Today, AFBBS functions under the aegis of Indian Air Force Educational and Cultural Society as a recognised,
 unaided private school. The school is affiliated to the Central Board of Secondary Education, New Delhi, and offers educational facilities under 10+2 scheme of education.

In the mid 1990s in an India Today survey the school was listed in the top 10 schools of New Delhi, rising to first in 1995. Various agencies have since ranked it in top 10 or top 15 lists.

In October 2005, the school celebrated its golden jubilee with a week-long festival, "Swarnajyoti",[2] with inter-school competitions. In 2007 AFBBS achieved ISO 9001-2000 certification.

In 2012 Air Marshal J. N. Burma at the school's annual day stated that as per Indian Air Force computer records,
 results of the school's pupils are the best in all schools run by the Indian Air Force.

The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind graced the 2022 investiture ceremony, and felicitated all the members of the student council.</H4>
